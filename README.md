# Hotel Decent
It is a Hotel Room Management Admin App where we have multiple rooms of multiple types. Each room type has a different type of pricing per hour. A hotel have 20 rooms for type A(1A-20A), 30 rooms for type B(1B-30B), 50 rooms for type C(1C-50C). 
We create an Admin dashboard where admin can view all the bookings both upcoming and passed with the filter of room number and room type,start time and end time.
